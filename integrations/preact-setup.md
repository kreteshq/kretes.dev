# Preact 

[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is a fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.  Preact combined with Kretes allows to quickly build **full-stack** TypeScript applications.
## Use the Preact template

```
kretes new preact-app --template preact
```

This starter sets up a Node.js application with Preact as the UI library. The goal is to provide a ready-to-use template for building full-stack applications in TypeScript that incorporate the best practices for both Preact and Node.js.
