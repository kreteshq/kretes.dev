# Solid.js

[Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com) is a purely reactive library. It was designed from the ground up with a reactive core. It's influenced by reactive principles developed by previous libraries.

## Use the Solid.js template

```
kretes new solid-app --template solid 
```

This starter sets up a Node.js application with Solid.js as the UI library. The goal is to provide a ready to use template to building full-stack application in TypeScript that incorporates the best practices for both Solid.js and Node.js.
