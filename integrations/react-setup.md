# React.js

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. React.js combined with Kretes allows to quickly build **full-stack** TypeScript applications.
## Use the React.js template

```
kretes new react-app --template react
```

This starter sets up a Node.js application with React.js as the UI library. The goal is to provide a ready-to-use template for building full-stack applications in TypeScript that incorporate the best practices for both React.js and Node.js.
