# Summary

Congratulations! You have now created a fullstack application in TypeScript with React.js as the UI library. We implemented the whole cycle. The application can not only read, but also change the database. This is not the end. I'll be extending this tutorial so that it covers as much as possible about creating full-stack TypeScript applications in React.js.

Next stop: Deployment. Subscribe to the newsletter to be in the loop.
